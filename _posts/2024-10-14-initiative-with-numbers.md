In ***Worlds without Number***, ***Initiative*** decides who acts when in combat. The higher your roll, the earlier you act within a round. Today, we'll take a look together at the intricacies of ***Initiative***, and why aiming high is worthwhile.
## Rounds, Turns, and Initiative
We'll start by explaining the basic concepts of combat. Combat in ***Worlds without Number*** is broken into rounds. Each round, participants each get a turn. Most actions are limited in that a participant can only use them as part of their turn. The order of turns is decided based on the ***Initiative*** people roll, which is used in all rounds of the combat.

The book describes two methods to determine ***Initiative***. The main method requires each side—or group—to roll 1d8 and add the highest Dexterity modifier of that side. Every member of a group uses the same number. The alternative, "individual initiative", works similarly, but requires each individual member to make this roll instead. 
### Players Are Favored
PCs are favored in terms of ***Initiative*** in two ways. First, like with other aspects in the game, PCs win any ties. This means that if NPCs and PCs roll the same number, the PC goes first. 

Second, NPCs usually have no modifier that they add to their 1d8 roll, while PCs do. A GM can make an exception, but this remains an exception. PCs also have inherent access to Foci that improve their ***Initiative***. The first level in ***Alert*** either gives your side a +1 bonus to initiative, or allows you to roll twice and take the better result for individual initiative. The second level even goes so far to make you act first by default.
## Manipulating Initiative
While characters are usually limited to acting on the turn decided by their ***Initiative***, exceptions exist which allow people to act at other times.
### Hold an Action and Delay an Action 
*Hold an Action* is a Move Action that allows a combatant to delay their remaining actions and use them at any time, even interrupting someone's turn to do so. Sometimes it may be preferable to wait to see what happens later during combat.

Similar to *Hold an Action*, *Delay an Action* is an On Turn action that allows a combatant to delay the remainder of their actions. Instead of being able to interrupt someone, you may only delay your actions until after a designated turn, without the ability to change this after the fact. The upside is of course that you do not need to spend your Move Action to delay your actions in this way.
### Snap Attack and Total Defense
Among the common combat actions, there are two more Instant Actions, *Snap Attack* and *Total Defense*. However, these options share more in common: they use your Main Action of the round, and can be used prior to your turn. To be clear, this is not a way to gain an extra Main Action, if you do not have your Main Action available for the round, you cannot use these actions.

*Snap Attack* allows an attacker to attack with a Ready weapon outside of their turn with a -4 penalty to hit. While harsh, something like ***Veteran's Luck*** completely negates this downside. In some cases, it may even be worthwhile to use *Snap Attack* after your turn. If you are unable to get into melee with an enemy, you could Move Action to close the distance, use *Delay an Action* to keep your Main Action for later, and then *Snap Attack* to interrupt their turn to attack them once they approach. While you can get close to this functionality with *Hold an Action*, you can not move closer to them first.

*Total Defense* adds a +2 bonus to the user's Armor Class until their next turn and makes them immune to Shock damage for the rest of the round. A potent buff, but especially so because you can explicitly wait to see if an attack would hit you without the bonus before using it, ensuring you negate at least one attack. As with *Snap Attack*, you could use *Delay an Action* to keep your Main Action for after an enemy acts. If you need *Total Defense*, you can use it, alternatively you still have your action. Of course this is not beneficial if you could have simply killed the enemy prior to their turn.
## The Bigger the Better
In the case of ***Initiative***, "the bigger the better" is an idiom that definitely applies. The reasons for this are multifold.
### Asymmetric Actions
While most actions in ***Worlds without Number*** intrinsically work in the same way no matter the timing, there do exist some actions whose power is instead asymmetric based on how early you act in combat. An easy example is *Total Defense*, which grants you +2 AC until the round ends. This is simply more turns for someone whose turn is first in a round compared to someone whose turn is last in a round. The latter can make up for this by spending their Main Action on *Total Defense* again, but the former can at that point use their action on potentially better options.

Another example is *Cast a Spell*, which is the action spellcasters use to cast their spells, as the name implies. If the spellcaster has suffered any damage in the round, they are unable to cast spells for the round. Worse yet if they are interrupted during the casting of a spell by damage, like through someone using *Hold an Action*, which makes them lose both the spell and spell slot. Obviously, there is a benefit to acting early in a round, because generally only people that use *Snap Attack* or those with a higher ***Initiative*** can deny you the ability to successfully cast your spell. If your ***Initiative*** is higher than everyone else, *Snap Attack* is their only remaining option, and while PCs have the luxury of ***Veteran's Luck***, similar options are less common among NPCs. This makes ***Alert*** an incredibly potent option for spellcasters.
### Denying Potential Actions
A property true for many TTRPGs is that characters are unable to act when dead or downed. If you beat an enemy to the punch and they die, you have basically negated all other turns they could have had in the combat scenario. Picture a scenario with one PC and one NPC. The PC is able to kill the NPC in one turn, while the NPC can deal five damage to the PC. If the NPC acts first, the PC leaves combat with five hit points than they started. If the PC acts first, the PC still has all their hit points! While combat may not be this black and white in reality, the same principle holds even when we add more allies or enemies. This is also why focusing on dealing with a single enemy at a time can be incredibly effective.
## Conclusion
While ***Initiative*** is simple to roll, there are various aspects to it that can complicate combat. In this article, we talk about many of these aspects, finishing off by explaining why being first is better than being last.
