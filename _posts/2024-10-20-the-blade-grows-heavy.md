I recently started and caught up to the Berserk manga, and I can now say that I get the hype for huge weapons. This brings me to the following: ***Worlds without Numbers*** struggles to make two-handed melee weapons a worthwhile investment. Today, we will look at the difference between the options players and characters face when looking to focus on melee combat.
## Your Weapon of Choice
Choosing your melee weapon of choice is a multi step process. If we disregard magic items, some considerations that can be made include:
1. What attribute should the weapon use? Strength or Dexterity? You will almost certainly choose the one with the higher modifier.
2. Should the weapon be one-handed or two-handed? This is something we'll talk about in more depth later.
After these steps it is mostly a matter of damage and Shock. Damage refers to the damage you deal on a hit excluding modifiers. Shock refers to the damage you deal on a miss excluding modifiers, and the AC threshold of this Shock. 

Both damage and Shock are important measures of the damage you deal in combat. Damage and Shock together determine the actual damage numbers you put out against a given foe. If the enemy has a low AC, you'll be hitting more often. If the enemy has a higher AC, you'll be dealing more Shock damage if their AC is at or below the AC threshold of the weapon.

Depending on the enemy and their AC, it may be worth using a different weapon with a smaller die if the Shock damage or AC threshold is higher, because you would deal more damage to them on average. Of course, the latter stops holding true after obtaining one level in ***Shocking Assault***, or two levels in ***Armsmaster*** or ***Close Combatant***, because with these you treat targets as having an AC of 10, which is lower than the threshold of any weapon. 

Some exceptions may of course exist, like if you want to use the *Shatter a Shield* action, you may specifically want to use an axe.

Next, we'll talk about the considerations of using a one-handed or two-handed weapon.
## Sword and Board
Using a weapon in one hand and a shield in the other, sometimes referred to as "sword and board", is a way to deal damage without losing out on any defenses. Both shield varieties add a +1 to your AC if you're already wearing equal or better armor than what the shields normally provide, and allow the user to ignore the first instance of Shock they would suffer each round. While the former is definitely useful, the latter is certain to come up if you're getting into melee skirmishes.

Using shields removes your ability to properly use two-handed weapons, as even with a small shield, you cannot wield a weapon with the same hand as the shield. Because of this, you become limited to using one-handed weapons.
## Two-Handed Weapons
Two-handed weapons generally have bigger dice for damage as well as bigger numbers for Shock than one-handed weapons, but as explained you are unable to wield a shield.

Is this worth the trade-off? It likely depends on the situation, but it is possible to give an answer which is good enough most of the time. For this we can use the following metric: Damage done per Damage taken. Using this metric, we can evaluate whether it is generally worthwhile to give up damage for defenses and vice versa.   

Let's say our DPR is 9.925 using a great sword to a given enemy given their AC of 13. That enemy has a DPR of 4.4 with their great hammer given our AC of 18. Our Damage done per Damage taken is $\frac{9.925}{4.4} = 2.256$. If we swap to a one-handed weapon, a long sword, to use a shield, our DPR is 8.625 instead, while the opponent's is 2.275, meaning our Damage done per Damage taken is $\frac{8.625}{2.275} = 3.791$. In this instance, using a two-handed weapon would not be a worthwhile trade-off, because our Damage done per Damage taken would be lower! However, this very much hinges on you taking Shock damage at AC 18 and not at AC 19 and that the enemy is not immune to your Shock damage.

It is also important to realize that almost all two-handed weapons can only use Strength for their attribute, meaning that if your Dexterity modifier is higher than your Strength modifier, you're likely better off using some other set up.
## Dual-Wielding Weapons
While we've now looked at using one one-handed weapon vs. using one two-handed weapon, we have not considered two one-handed weapons! If you wish to use two one-handed weapons, you can make use of the rules on Dual-Wielding Weapons. To summarize: if you wield two weapons, you can still attack with just one of them, but add a +2 on the damage roll, excluding Shock damage, by taking a -1 penalty on your to hit roll.

A common combination before AC thresholds can be ignored through Foci levels is using a short sword in one hand, which can deal Shock damage to most enemies, namely with AC 15 or below, and a stiletto in the other, which has a whopping AC threshold of 18. However, after you pick up a level in ***Shocking Assault*** or similar, the long sword becomes the king of the game.

While a -1 penalty to your to hit roll could sound rough, dealing damage on a miss lessens the blow considerably. If we add to that the increased damage on a hit, taking the penalty does often lead to an increase in DPR, even if small. Let's take the same example as before, we are facing an opponent with an AC of 13, but now use a long sword. If we do 8.625 DPR by default, we would do 9.7 DPR by wielding another weapon in our off-hand and making a dual-wielding attack.

An added benefit to dual-wielding weapons is that one of the weapons can in fact be a shield! This way, you can simply attack normally when the AC from the shield is more beneficial than dealing more damage. This is because when you use the shield as a weapon, you also lose the defensive benefits from the shield as explained in their section on page 36 of main book.

If we compare dual-wielding to utilizing a two-handed, there's not much that the two-handed option has going for it. Compare the 9.925 DPR from the great sword I mentioned before to the 9.7 DPR using a long sword while dual wielding; yes, the great sword does slightly more damage, but at a pretty big cost. Using a great sword makes you wholly unable to use a shield, unlike a combination of sword and board, where you dual-wielding attack when appropriate. Additionally, maybe less important in some games, you can have both a magical weapon and a magical shield in the latter set up, while this is not possible in the former. Finally, unlike two-handed weapons, one-handed weapons are almost all useable with Dexterity or Strength, instead of just Strength.
## Conclusion
There are multitudes of different weapons, but there's sadly little reason to use two-handed weapons. If you're looking for better defenses, one-handed weapons will allow you to use a shield in your off-hand, which also allows you to almost the same damage as two-handed weapons do using dual-wielding attacks in a pinch.
